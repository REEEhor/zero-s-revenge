# Story
*It was a peaceful sunny day and numbers were playing outside. The game they played was adding and subtracting. Two numbers added themselves together and... Wow! New number! 3 and 5 created 8.*
>*Me! Me!*

*Shouted -3. I want to play as well. So the 3 and -3 added themselves and... What? The number they created was different. When it tried to add or subtract itself from any other number, nothing happened.*
> *We don't want to play with you!
Shouted someone.*


*Number 0, that was just born, was sad.*
> *Look! I bring you multiplication!*

*But when it tried to multiply itself with someone else, the other number disappeared.*

> *Ok, that is it!*

*said the big 63.*

> *Get out! Your multiplication is stupid, you don't belong here.The only thing you make is yourself, how selfish!*

*And so the 0 went away. But it asked itself...*
>*What if this is the thing that I want to do? I will multiply... no... even **DIVIDE!** every number, that said I was stupid.*

*So it picked up the gun that shoots multiplication a started shooting...*
